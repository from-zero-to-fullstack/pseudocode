# Project

From zero to FullStack - an unofficial course led by [Pedro Soares](https://github.com/pncsoares) with the aim of guiding and helping two friends to learn programming and become software developers.

# Introduction

This repository aims to create some `.md` files so that Mariana and Cristina can describe daily tasks using pseudocode.
