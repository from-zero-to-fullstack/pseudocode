# Project

From zero to FullStack - an unofficial course led by [Pedro Soares](https://github.com/pncsoares) with the aim of guiding and helping two friends to learn programming and become software developers.

# Introduction

This repository aims to create some `.md` files so that Mariana and Cristina can describe daily tasks using pseudocode.

ðŸ’¡ There's no right or wrong in pseudocode, it's all a matter of describing all the steps well and clearly.

# Pseudocodes to write

You don't need to write all at once. You can write one per day or another rythim that you choose.
